			<h2>Regional Ramen - Hokkaido</h2>
			<p class="made">Written by <a href="#">MorganDamopoli</a> on May 16, 2021.</p>
			
			<p>Ramen in Japan's northernmost region is as rich and varied as anywhere else in the country. While miso, salt or soy sauce form the basis of most of the ramen here, lard is a common ingredient, giving ramen in Hokkaido a decidedly unique depth. Noodles in the region tend towards the medium-thick and curly, a perfect complement to the thick flavours and winter heartiness. Here is a simple introduction to some of the types of ramen in Hokkaido.</p>

			<p>There are varying accounts on the origin of ramen, with some saying that the earliest instance of ramen in Japan occurred as long ago as 1665, when prominent daimyo Mito Mitsukuni (also known as Mito Komon) tasted a Chinese dish which featured noodles in a soup. However, it is generally believed that ramen was introduced to Japan from China when the country opened its borders during the Meiji Period, originating from the Chinese restaurants in Yokohama’s Chinatown. “Ramen” comes from the Chinese word “lamian,” which literally means “pulled noodles.” Although the first official ramen restaurant, Rairaiken, opened in Asakusa in 1910, ramen did not become popular until after World War II, with cheap American flour being introduced to the Japanese market and soldiers stationed in China opening up ramen restaurants after returning, the dish being "Japanized" in the process. Ramen cemented its place as an important part of Japanese cuisine in 1958, when Momofuku Ando introduced instant noodles to the world, which was later named the greatest Japanese invention of the 20th century; today, the average Japanese person eats instant noodles 40 times a year. In recent decades, ramen has taken off even further in popularity, with a wide variety of types being invented and countless ramen restaurants (called ramen-ya) opening in Japan and worldwide.</p>
